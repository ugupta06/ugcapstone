                <p>A steganography tool involves concealing information within other non-secret digital data, such as an image or video file. This technique hides the existence of the information, allowing for secure and discreet communication. It is commonly used to protect the privacy of data by embedding it within ordinary files where it is not easily detectable.</p>

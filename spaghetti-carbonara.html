            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>400g spaghetti</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>100g Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
                <li>200g pancetta or guanciale, cubed</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
                <li>Black pepper, freshly ground</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook until al dente, about 8-10 minutes. Reserve a cup of pasta water and then drain the spaghetti.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together eggs and Parmesan until well combined.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the pancetta with a little olive oil until it starts to get crispy, about 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Remove garlic and discard.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low and add the drained spaghetti to the skillet. Toss well to coat the spaghetti in the pancetta fat.</li>
                <li>Remove the skillet from heat. Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture into the pasta, whisking vigorously to prevent the eggs from scrambling. If the pasta seems too dry, add a little reserved pasta water.</li>
                <li>Season generously with freshly ground black pepper and serve immediately. Garnish with more grated Parmesan if desired.</li>
            </ol>
